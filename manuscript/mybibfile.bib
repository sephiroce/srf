   abstract = {In recent years, conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved outstanding performance in image and speech processing applications. Unfortunately, the pooling operation in CNN ignores important spatial information which is an important attribute in many applications. The recently proposed capsule network retains spatial information and improves the capabilities of traditional CNN. It uses capsules to describe features in multiple dimensions and dynamic routing to increase the statistical stability of the network.
	In this work, we first use capsule network for overlapping digit recognition problem. We evaluate the performance of the network with respect to recognition accuracy, convergence and training time per epoch. We show that capsule network achieves higher accuracy when training set size is small. When training set size is larger, capsule network and conventional CNN have comparable recognition accuracy. The training time per epoch for capsule network is longer than conventional CNN because of the dynamic routing algorithm. An analysis of the GPU timing shows that adjusting the capsule structure can help decrease the time complexity of the dynamic routing algorithm significantly.
	Next, we design a capsule network for speech recognition, specifically, overlapping word recognition. We use both capsule network and conventional CNN to recognize 2 overlapping words in speech files created from 5 word classes. We show that capsule network achieves a considerably higher recognition accuracy (96.92\%) compared to conventional CNN (85.19\%). Our results show that capsule network recognizes overlapping word by recognizing each individual word in the speech. We also verify the scalability of capsule network by increasing the number of word classes from 5 to 10. Capsule network still shows a high recognition accuracy of 95.42\% in case of 10 words while the accuracy of conventional CNN decreases sharply to 73.18\%.},

   abstract = {Recently, the deep neural network structure caps-net was proposed by Sabouret al. [11]. Capsule networks are designed to learn relative geometry betweenthe features of a layer and the features of the next layer. The Capsule network’smain building blocks are capsules, which are represented by vectors. The ideais that each capsule will represent a feature as well as traits or subfeatures ofthat feature. This allows for smart information routing. Capsules traits are usedto predict the traits of the capsules in the next layer, and information is sent toto next layer capsules on which the predictions agree. This is called routing byagreement.This thesis investigates theoretical support of new and existing routing al-gorithms as well as evaluates their performance on the MNIST [16] and CIFAR-10 [8] datasets. A variation of the dynamic routing algorithm presented in theoriginal paper [11] achieved the highest accuracy and fastest execution time. },

    abstract = "In this study, we first investigate a novel capsule network with dynamic routing for linear time Neural Machine Translation (NMT), referred as CapsNMT. CapsNMT uses an aggregation mechanism to map the source sentence into a matrix with pre-determined size, and then applys a deep LSTM network to decode the target sequence from the source representation. Unlike the previous work (CITATION) to store the source sentence with a passive and bottom-up way, the dynamic routing policy encodes the source sentence with an iterative process to decide the credit attribution between nodes from lower and higher layers. CapsNMT has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and provides a more flexible way to aggregate the part-whole information of the source sentence. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, CapsNMT achieves comparable results with the Transformer system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically investigated for sequence to sequence problems.",

In this paper, we explore the capsule networks used for relation extraction in a multi-instance multi-label learning framework and propose a novel neural approach based on capsule networks with attention mechanisms. We evaluate our method with different benchmarks, and it is demonstrated that our method improves the precision of the predicted relations. Particularly, we show that capsule networks improve multiple entity pairs relation extraction.",
